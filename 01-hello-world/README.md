# HELLO, WORLD!
Let's get started nice and easy with the most basic of projects, shall we?

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Create a basic HTML page which says "Hello, World!" inside of an &lt;h1&gt; tag.

  * Your HTML page should link to an external stylesheet as well as an external JavaScript file.

  * In your external JavaScript file, simply use `console.log` to log the text "Hello World" to the console.

  * Open the webpage in your browser and open your developer tools to the console to verify your `console.log` statement worked.
