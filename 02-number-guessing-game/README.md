# NUMBER GUESSING GAME
For your first real challenge, you will be building a number guessing game. The application will generate a random number and the user will attempt to guess that number.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Your HTML page should include a text input and a submit button.

  * When the page loads, generate a random number using JavaScript. The random number can be within any range of numbers you choose.

  * The user should be able to input a number in the input box and click the submit button. When the submit button is clicked, tell the user either:

    a) their guess is too high;<br>
    b) their guess is too low; or<br>
    c) they guessed correctly.

## EXTRA CREDIT
  * Keep track of the number of times the user has made a guess.

  * Only give the user a maximum number of guesses (i.e., three guesses) before they lose and the game resets.
