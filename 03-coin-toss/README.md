# COIN TOSS
Allow the user to guess HEADS or TAILS. Tell them if they picked correctly. Display statistics on their selections.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Your HTML page should include a button for HEADS and a button for TAILS.

  * The user should be able to select either HEADS or TAILS and when they click one of the buttons you will display whether they selected correctly or not.

  * If the user has played at least once, display their winning statistics: total number of games, average win rate, number of times selected (HEADS and TAILS), and number of wins (HEADS and TAILS). For example:

    - **HEADS**<br>
    Times Selected: XX<br>
    Times Won: XX<br>
    Average Win Rate: XX.XX%

    - **TAILS**<br>
    Times Selected: XX<br>
    Times Won: XX<br>
    Average Win Rate: XX.XX%

    Overall Win Rate: XX.XX%

  * **Hint**: Win rates can be calculated for each coin side by dividing the number of times the side was selected into the number of times the selection was correct. The overall win rate will be the total number of selections divided by the total number of games.

## EXTRA CREDIT
  * Use (Google Charts)[https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/areachart] to display the statistics in chart form.

  * Add animations/transitions when updating, showing, or hiding elements.
