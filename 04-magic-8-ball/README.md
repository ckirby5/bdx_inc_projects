# MAGIC 8 BALL
Allow the user to ask a question. Return a random response from the magic 8-ball.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Your HTML page should include a text input to allow the user to ask a question and a submit button.

  * When the user types a question and clicks submit, you will randomly return a response from "The Magic 8-Ball"

  Here are some possible responses, but be creative with it:

      - I think that it will work out!
      - Maybe... maybe not.
      - Probably not.
      - Highly likely.
      - It is certain!
      - I don't know about that.

  * The page should remove the text input and submit button and replace it with the users question and the Magic 8-balls response.

  * There should be an "Ask Again" button which brings the text input and submit button back and removes the question and response.

## EXTRA CREDIT
  * Add basic client-side form validation to your text input to ensure that the user has not left the field blank.

  * Animate the transition when the user asks a question to fade out the text input and submit button and fade in the Magic 8-Ball's response.

      - Remember to animate again when the "Ask Again" button is clicked!
