# RANDOM NAME GENERATOR
After the last few projects, this one will be a walk in the park. You will ask the user to enter their name and then you will generate a new name for them.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Your HTML page should include a text input to allow the user to enter their name as well as a submit button.

  * When the user types their name and clicks submit, you will display a randomly generated name based on the input.

      * For example, if the user were to type in the name 'Topher' they can expect to receive a random name back, like: 'Simple Topher' or 'Super Topher'.

## EXAMPLE
There is no example for this project. Be creative.
