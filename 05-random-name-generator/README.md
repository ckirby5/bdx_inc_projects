# RANDOM NAME GENERATOR
Ask the user to enter their name. Use their name to generate a new name for them.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Your HTML page should include a text input to allow the user to enter their name as well as a submit button.

  * When the user types their name and clicks submit, you will display a randomly generated name based on their name.

      * For example, if the user were to type in the name 'Topher' they might get a random name like: 'Simple Topher' or 'Super Topher' back.

  * The page should remove the text input and submit button and replace it with the randomly generated name.

  * There should be a "Regenerate Name" button which generates a new random name and displays it.
