# MOUSE POSITION
For this project you will create a basic application which tracks the users mouse position in real time. When the user clicks, you will generate a random basic shape at the mouse position and animate the shape.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * You must track the mouse/cursor position in real-time and display the X and Y coordinates of the mouse position as it moves.

  * When the user clicks anywhere on the page you will generate a new random basic shape (circle or square) at the current mouse position. The cursor should be in the center of the basic shape when the shape is created.

  * The basic shape that is generated should have a random color and a random opacity.

  * The shape should begin animating once it is created. How you animate the shape is up to you. This can be a pre-defined animation in CSS or one that is programmatically created with JavaScript.

## EXAMPLE
