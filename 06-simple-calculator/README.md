# SIMPLE CALCULATOR
Accept two numbers and add/subtract/multiply/divide them.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Your HTML page should include two (2) text inputs to allow the user to enter two numbers. In addition, it should have an 'Add', 'Subtract', 'Multiply', and 'Divide' button.

  * When the user enters two numbers and clicks 'Add', you will add the two numbers and display the entire math sentence, i.e.: 6 + 3 = 9

  * Similarly, when the 'Subtract' button is clicked you will subtract the two numbers and display the entire math sentence, i.e.: 6 - 3 = 3

  * Repeat this process for multiply and divide.

## EXTRA CREDIT
  * If your solution uses separate functions to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, refactor your code to use a single function to handle the calculations. Such as:

      - `compute(6, 3, 'add');` or;
      - `compute(6, 3, 'multiply');`

  * Add basic client-side form validation to your text inputs to ensure that the user has:

        a) not left the field blank, and;

        b) only submitted numerical input (no alpha/special characters)

## EXAMPLE
There is no example for this project. Be creative.
