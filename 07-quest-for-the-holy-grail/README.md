# QUEST FOR THE HOLY GRAIL!
In the last several projects, you've focused pretty heavily on JavaScript. For this lesson, you will get a little break from that and will have an opportunity to focus a little more on CSS.

Before you begin, story time -

In web design, the **holy grail** refers to a web page layout which has multiple equal height columns that are defined using style sheets. This layout style is commonly desired, although the ways in which it can be implemented with current technologies all have drawbacks. Because of this, finding an optimal implementation has been likened to searching for the elusive Holy Grail.

The layout described looks something like this:

The real tricky part of this is the equal height columns to the right and left of the content box. In the past, developers might have used tables, faux columns, javascript, positioning, and other methods to achieve this result. Most of these solutions, however, felt like hacks and workarounds. So, for a very long time, achieving this layout was quite frustrating; that is until our friend flexbox (and later, grid) came to the party and changed everything.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Create a layout similar to the one in the image above which includes a header, footer, and multiple equal height columns (at least two).

## EXTRA CREDIT
  * Using media queries, ensure that your layout is responsive on mobile phones. Take a look at the example and try resizing your browser window to see an example. Notice the layout changes when it hits a certain breakpoint.
