# SIMPLE CALCULATOR
Create a calculator that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## SPECIFICATIONS
  * Your calculator should allow the user to click buttons to enter a number followed by a function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

  * After selecting a function, the user should be able to enter another number followed by another function or the equals button.

  * The user should be able to continue entering numbers followed by functions any number of times.

  * After each function, the calculated result should be displayed.

## EXTRA CREDIT
  * Create an 'AC/C' button which clears the currently displayed number on the first click and clears the entire calculator memory on the second click.
    - 'AC' stands for 'all clear' which will clear all numbers previously entered.
    - 'C' stands for 'clear' which will only clear the most recent number entered.

  * See if you can handle keyboard events to allow the user to enter numbers and functions (+, -, /, &#42;, and =) in the calculator from their keyboard. Also handle the enter key the same as you would the '=' sign.
